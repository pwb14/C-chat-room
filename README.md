# C-chat-room

Uses: C

This is a chat room application that allows for the creation of multiple chat rooms and for many clients to join and communicate in these rooms.

DISCLAIMER:
The first section of this code (initializing the sockets and binding) was provided by the professor.  I have identified the following issues with this code, but was told not to fix them by the professor for the sake of the project:

bzero call

init size of the sockaddr_in in accept() call not set

much of the stream-oriented stuff is not set properly
